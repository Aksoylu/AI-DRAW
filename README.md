I did this project at the workshop he attended as a speaker. In fact, we did it together.
At the workshop that I attended with the invitation of Yıldız Technical University Mint Club and data science community, we held an event that lasted three hours with over 150+ people. 
We have created this project together with the live coding event.

## Dependencies 
You have to install followed libraries with your command line and pip:
- pip install flask
- pip install Flask-Cors
- pip install tensorflow
- pip install keras
- pip install numpy
- pip install pandas
- pip install opencv-python

## How to use ?

- For training model, run "server.py"
- For predicting images with trained model, run "predict.py"
- There is already a pretrained model exist. So, you can directly start your web app by running "server.py"
